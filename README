The vc bundle
-----------------------------------
This is a script based approach to version control for TeX
documents.  It works more reliably than keyword substitution
based approaches, since it tracks all files in a working
copy, not only .tex files.

The vc bundle works with LaTeX and plain TeX.  Currently,
Bazaar, Git, Mercurial and Subversion are supported.


What's special about the vc bundle?
-----------------------------------
* Common version control packages for LaTeX use keyword
  substitution to access revision information.  That
  approach doesn't work reliably in the presence of
  non-.tex files, e.g., graphics or graphic sources that
  are processed by an external tool.
* The author is unaware of any alternative version control
  packages for plain TeX.
* The author is unaware of any alternative LaTeX version
  control packages that support Bazaar or Git.
